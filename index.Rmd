## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to analyze the correlation between the percentage of men who come to womens sporting events and the amount of coverage womens sports get on sports stations.

If this idea does not work, then I will look into the correlation between location within the united states and the political party people associate with. 

My third idea would be to analyze the correlation between the enaction of Roe v. Wade and the amount of births occuring within the United States, as well as the repeal of Roe v. Wade and the amount of births occuring within the United States.
